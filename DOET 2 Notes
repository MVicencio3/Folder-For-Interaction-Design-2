How People Do things
  2 people will do two things that is gulf of exectution and evaluation. For Eecution is where they try to figure out how it operates. For Evalutation its where they try to figure out what happened.
Basically execution is how the use of somethjing and evaluation is to see what happens after using it
It's important to implement signifiers, constaints, and mappiung for execution
Feedback and conceptual models for evaluation

The seven stages of Action
   Goal
  Execution - 3 stages
    Plan
    Specify
    Perform
  Evaluation - 3 stages
    Perceive

  Seven stages provide a useful guidline for understanding designs that are made for humans. Not every design has to require all of each stage.

Human Thoughts
  Human mind is important as its used for design when trying to understand what we want. 
  Designs will usually be faulty, difficult to use and understand (Strengthen the use  of seven stages of action)
  We are unawarte of our subconsious processses so understanding what other people beliueve and behave are often going to be wrong, (We are humans we are hard creatures to understnad which I really agree with in the book)
  The books says the human mind is immensely complex having evolved over long periods of time of multiple discplines and behavor sequences, with a bunch of things influenceing it aswell. We have so many discouveries of the human brain but yet there is stil lalot to acheive to know what the human brain is capable of.
Subconcious - Fast, Automatic, Multiple resources, Controls skilled behavior
Concious, Slow, Controlled, Limited Resources, Invoked when learning or in danger

Human Cognition and Emotion
  Theres three different levels of processing
    Reflective- Where we think of consequences. When decision making takes place and takes over on the outcomes and responsiblity.
    Behavioral- The home of learned skills. This is more like thinking before we take action when it comes to speaking or playing sports. But it goes a little more detailed. When we pick up a cup we techinically pick it up buit never really thing about our finger placement or how we should hold it since its already in our system to know how to pick something up.
    Visceral0- The most basic Level of Processing basically called lizard brain. makes quick judgments about if something is bad or good. So maybe kinda like intuition and reflexes?. Visceral Learning takes place by sensitization or desenitization through adapting.

The seven stages of action and the three levels of processing
  Lowest level- visceral levels of calmness or anxiety 
  Middle level- Behavioral ones dirven by expectations and execution like hope and fear
  Highest level- The reflective emotions, ones that assess the results in terms of the presumed agents and the consequences long term
tasks that are to easy causes bordem
Tasks that are to hard causes frustration

People as Storytellers
  Stories resonate with our experiences and provide examples of new instances. Conceptual models are a form of story resolting from our predisposition to find explanations. This gives us a better understanding on our experiences and predict the outcomes of our actions. Problem is these miodels are constructed
