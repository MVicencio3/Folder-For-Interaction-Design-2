### Chapter 4 Part 1

For chapter 4 Part 1 the main part of the chapter that I can grab is learning about constraints. There are 4 Constraints and what I feel like they all have in common is that these four constraints are basically restricted to follow rules of the world in a way to have a better design when designing. It's kinda hard to explain but more easier to kinda relate to one. Like for cultural restraint it's kind of followed different in each location but has kind of the same meaning in a way. Just done differently. In the book it talks about red being a color where we are wired to stop at anypoint of recognition. This goes with what i was saying for it follows the rules of the world as everyone will thing that a red sign is to stop. This really got me thinking about other cultural restraints like greetings. No matter what in the world a simple hand gesture of a wave or a bow can be seen as a hi in every part of the world. In simple ways we are designed to think of these simple patterns as a behavior system for the world to be accustomed to. We are taught at a young age or through just simple observation that these situations are widely known throughout the world.
